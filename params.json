First, I introduce the idea that the mobile device admits several **access privileges**. In that sense, the whole set of information that is stored on it just cannot be access all of the time. Such an approach implies that the user must define a specific access (**private**, **protected** or **public**) for each app installed onto the device. <br> Hence, each time the user has to be authenticated on the system, the decision is made as follows: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorentinTh/SpeakerAuthentication/master/art/decision.jpg\"/>\r\n\r\nMore informations\r\n---\r\nAs a student member of the **[LIARA](http://liara.uqac.ca/)** laboratory that is affiliated to the « **C**haire de **R**echerche sur l’**I**ntelligence **A**mbiante et les technologies d’**A**ssistance **C**ognitive (**CRIAAC**) » at the « **U**niversité du **Q**uébec **À** **C**hicoutimi (**[UQAC](http://www.uqac.ca/)**) », I worked on this application since January 2015 that was my graduation project to complete my MSc. in computer science. \r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n---\r\n**[Florentin Thullier](https://github.com/florentinth)** - _2016_\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n---\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorentinTh/SpeakerAuthentication/master/art/01.png\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorentinTh/SpeakerAuthentication/master/art/02.png\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorentinTh/SpeakerAuthentication/master/art/03.png\"/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorentinTh/SpeakerAuthentication/master/art/04.png\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorentinTh/SpeakerAuthentication/master/art/05.png\"/> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorentinTh/SpeakerAuthentication/master/art/06.png\"/>\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n---\r\n**Warning** : this version remains an experimental one that may produce some bugs. <br> _link comming soon_\r\n\r\n[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/nightly-1.0-green.svg)]()\r\n\r\nDataset\r\n---\r\nI also release the dataset I used to conduct the experimentations. <br> You can simply download it over here : <br> _link comming soon_\r\n\r\n[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/dataset-2MB-green.svg)]()\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---\r\n    Copyright 2016 Florentin Thullier.\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
